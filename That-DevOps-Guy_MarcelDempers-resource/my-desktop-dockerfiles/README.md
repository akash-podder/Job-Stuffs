# My Desktop

I run all my apps on containers. <br/>
This repo is inspired by Jessie Frazelle [dockerfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles)

Some of my apps are just bashrc aliases to her docker images on hub.docker.com
Other images I have had to hack around and made few tweaks :)

## Containers

All apps are under `dockerfiles` folder. Every app has a `install.sh` which will put an alias into your `bashrc` so you can run the container.

I also maintain my bashrc in this repo.
